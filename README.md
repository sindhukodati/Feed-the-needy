# Feed-the-needy
Food is one of the basic necessities of humans, it stands first among all basic 
needs. It is important as it nourishes the human body-sustaining the very existences of humans. 
However, with the rising population and development of this country a drastic increase can be 
seen in food waste. As per data given by Food and Agriculture Organization 
(http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/flw-data), 1/3rd of food produced for human 
consumption is wasted globally, which accounts for almost 1.3 billion tons per year. On the 
other hand, also as per WHO 20% of the population face extreme food shortages. Food wastage 
has increasingly become a major problem. There are restaurants, weddings, social functions, 
college canteens, and many other social events where tons of food is wasted. Poor people 
frequently face the hunger problem. There are many people who wish to donate food to the 
needy but are unaware of how exactly they can execute that. The food waste management 
website is built to help the hungry people. Feed the needy website is a mission to end hunger 
and no wasting of food to make a hungry-free world. The focus of this project is to reduce the 
amount of food wasted and being used to the needy people. 

 Feed the needy website has two modules donor and receiver. If the donor wants to 
donate the food, they have to login by entering their details like username and password. Then 
a donor form appears with the details like name, mobile number, address and serving capacity. 
The donor has to enter the details and submit it. If the receiver wants the food, he has to login 
after sign in. Then a table appears showing the details of the donor. The receiver can select any 
of the donor and contact them for the food. After donating the donor deletes his details from 
the donor table by clicking change status on home page. 

Food Waste is a massive problem. One third of all food produced in the world goes to waste. 
From restaurant scraps, to grocers disposing of imperfect produce, to spoiled food, roughly 
$400B in food ends up in landfills every year resulting in 3.3 billion metric tons of greenhouse 
gases annually. At the same time, worldwide nearly 800 million people do not have enough to 
eat. That means one in nine people are suffering from hunger. Hunger and malnutrition are the 
number one risk to health worldwide 

 This web-based Food Waste Management system can assist in donating the 
leftover food from hotels & restaurants to those in need. If the donor wants to donate the food, 
they have to login by entering their details like username and password. Then a donor form 
appears with the details like name, mobile number, address and serving capacity. The donor 
has to enter the details and submit it. If the receiver wants the food, he has to login after sign 
in. Then a table appears showing the details of the donor. The receiver can select any of the 
donor and contact them for the food. After donating the donor deletes his details from the donor 
table by clicking change status on home page. In this way this web-based food waste 
management system will help restaurants/functions to reduce food waste and will help in 
feeding the poor and needy people.

 In highly populated countries like India, food wastage is a disturbing issue. The 
streets, garbage bins and landfills have ample proof to prove it. Marriages, canteens, 
restaurants, social and family get-togethers and functions expel out so much food. Food 
wastage is not only an indication of hunger or pollution, but also of many economic problems. 
The high standard of living has resulted in the wastage of food, clothes, etc. because of quick 
changes in habits and lifestyle. Instead of wasting these things we can put them in use by 
donating them to various organizations such as orphanages, old age homes, etc. The product is 
an internet-based web application that basically aims at charity through donations. The 
proposed application shall reduce food wastage and also fulfill their requirements.
 As mentioned above in the description there is a lot of food wastage that occurs daily at 
restaurants and cafes. Instead of throwing away the same as trash (which usually is the 
scenario), it can be used to feed the homeless. Benefiters will be both the restaurants/caf√©s 
(reducing the wastage), and the needy. 

 The ultimate objective of this project is to communicate that investments in food 
wastage reduction is the most logical step in the pursuit of sustainable production and 
consumption, including food security, climate change and other adverse environmental effects. 
Public awareness materials and a strategy will be developed to this effect. 

PURPOSE:

 Feed the needy website is a mission to end hunger and no wasting of food to make a 
hungry-free world. The focus of this project is to reduce the amount of food wasted and being 
used to the needy people.
